# 🎓 PeerTask – Student-to-Student Micro-Tasking Platform

**PeerTask** is a collaborative web app where students can post small academic or personal tasks and get them done by peers — in exchange for a small reward or return favor. Whether it’s making a PPT, formatting notes, or compiling data, PeerTask makes it easier for students to help each other within their own campus ecosystem.
